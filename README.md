# Scanpy Clustering Tutorial

This repository contains my implementation of the **Scanpy clustering tutorial** ([link](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/basics/clustering.html)), which covers basic single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis using Python and Scanpy.

## Overview
The tutorial demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing scRNA-seq data
- Quality control (QC) and filtering
- Normalization and log transformation
- Highly variable gene (HVG) selection
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Neighbor graph construction
- Clustering (Leiden algorithm)
- Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization
